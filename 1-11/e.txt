>How would you test the word count program?

I would think of special scenarios like doubling of characters that are
being tested for. Additionally, the output of the program in boundary
conditions such as no to very little input, or a lot of input.

>What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Technically, random strings of characters. However in that case you
would need to have already working program(s) to verify the results of
your tests since it would be very cumbersome for a human to do it by
hand. Sensible input such as texts would produce suboptimal results in
the bug-testing process, due to the low amount of obscure scenarios.
Obvious bugs would be found far prior using simple strings of
characters to the commitment to a large scale testing. However,
depending on the size of the texts used, a proportional amount of
certainty should be obtained regarding the usability of the program due
to the law of large numbers, nevermind the bugs in such case.
